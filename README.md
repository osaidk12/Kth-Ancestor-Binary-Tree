# Kth-Ancestor-Binary-Tree
This project finds the Kth ancestor of a given node in a binary tree using recursion.  It traverses the tree, backtracks when necessary, and counts ancestors.  The approach ensures efficiency by using depth-first search (DFS).  Handles cases where the Kth ancestor does not exist.
